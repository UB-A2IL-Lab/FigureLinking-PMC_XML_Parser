In this model, the highest risk of failure occurred among patients harbouring isoniazid and rifampin resistant isolates (OR 40.53, 95% CI 23.74 to 69.18, p< 0.001) compared with patients with pansusceptible isolates; the analyses were adjusted for previous diagnosis of DM, sex, age, previous TB treatment and malnutrition (Table 4).10.1371/journal.pone.0129312.t004 Table 4: Association of treatment failure with DM and other patient characteristics among patients with pulmonary TB among the subgroup of patients with antimicrobial susceptibility results, by multivariate analyses* Mexico 2000-2012.. #caption-ended-head#00002#.
